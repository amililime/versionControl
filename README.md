Here you will find study material gathered with simple explanations that you can apply in order to facilitate effective learning.

# 1- What is Git?

  Git is a distributed version control system 
  that allows multiple people to collaborate on projects efficiently. 
  It tracks changes made to files,
  stores those changes and 
  allows easy collaboration and merging of changes from different contributors.


# 2-The most common Git commands:

  # git init: 
  Initializes a new Git repository.

  # git clone:
  Creates a copy of a remote repository.

  # git add:
  Adds files or changes to the staging area.
  
  # git commit: 
  Records changes to the repository with a descriptive message.

  # git push: 
  Uploads local branch commits to a remote repository.

  # git pull: 
  Downloads and integrates remote changes into the current branch.

  # git branch: 
  Lists, creates, or deletes branches.

  # git checkout:
  Switches branches or restores files from a specific commit.

  # git merge:
  Integrates changes from one branch into another.

  # git status:
  Shows the current status of the repository.


# 3-Branches, tags, commits, stash command, hooks:

      Branches: Git branches are independent lines of development that allow for parallel work on different features or bug fixes.

      Tags: Git tags are used to label specific points in history, such as release versions, for easy reference.

      Commits: Git commits are snapshots of the repository at a specific point in time, representing a set of changes made to the files.

      Stash command: The git stash command allows you to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed, so you can switch to a different branch or work on something else.

      Hooks: Git hooks are scripts that can be triggered at certain points in Git's execution, such as before or after a commit, to automate tasks or enforce rules.
